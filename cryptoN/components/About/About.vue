            <p>
              Developed by 4 computer engineer students at Beykent University.
              CryptoN is a platform that aims to build a new creative economy—a
              world where creators can use the Ethereum blockchain to value
              their work in entirely new ways, and build stronger connections
              with their supporters. Foundation fosters a network of mutual
              support between creators and collectors. We’re forging a
              community-driven path and sharing our tools with the rapidly
              evolving group of developers who are excited to define this future
              with us. We want anyone and everyone who cares about the future of
              digital expression to be a part of it.
